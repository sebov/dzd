    "- Sampling techniques - sample a subset of the dataset, e.g., using random sampling, stratified\n",
    "  sampling, - introduce a parameter `FRAC` that defines the fraction of the dataset to be sampled.\n",
    "- Summarization techniques - apply clustering/gridding/binning to group similar instances and\n",
