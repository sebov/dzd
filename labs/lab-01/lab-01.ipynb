Check the sizeof the files, the number of rows and columns, the actual data types, etc. You can use a tool of your choice (pandas, dask, pyspark, pyarrow, etc.) - the one you can install and run locally or an online tool it supports large files. Is it possible to load the entire dataset in memory? Even if it is possible in your case, try to think about scenarios where there is not enough memory available. Consequently, you should design your solutions so that they do not require loading the entire dataset at once."

    "Implement a simple Naive Bayes classifier on your own that can be applied to large datasets - it should be able to process the dataset in parts, e.g., by processing one column or batch of rows at a time. Alternatively, you can use different model from available libraries, as long as it can be applied to large datasets. Be creative!\n",

Prepare your solution so that you can easily change the parameters of the techniques you use and compare the results, computation time and the size of the processed data used for training the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Process the full dataset in parts - process the dataset in parts, e.g., by processing one column at a time for Naive Bayes (compute the necessary distributions for each column) or by processing batches of rows and creating an ensemble of models.\n",
    "- Sampling techniques - sample a subset of the dataset, e.g., using random sampling, stratified sampling, - introduce a parameter `FRAC` that defines the fraction of the dataset to be sampled.\n",
    "- Summarization techniques - apply clustering/gridding/binning to group similar instances and aggregate the values within each cluster/bin. E.g., you can use location-related features (pickup and dropoff coordinates) to create bins and aggregate (you can take the mean for numerical features and the majority value \"*mode*\" for categorical features) the rides which have pickup and dropoff locations within the same bin. \n",
    "- Quantization techniques - reduce the number of distinct values for numerical features, e.g., by applying rounding, flooring, ceiling, or other techniques. Store values with reduced precision - it can reduce I/O time and memory usage and consequently speed up the computations. "
