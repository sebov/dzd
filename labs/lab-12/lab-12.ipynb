    "Many of the approaches to association rule learning, including the Apriori algorithm, are based on\n",
    "generating candidate itemsets and filtering them according to their support values. However, the\n",

    "Frequent Pattern Tree is a data structure to represent transactions in a compact way. The FP-Tree is\n",

    "- sort the remaining items in each transaction in descending order of their frequency\n",
    "- start with an empty FP-Tree consisting of a single dummy node (the root node)\n",
