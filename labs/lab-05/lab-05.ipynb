    "- Apache Hadoop\n",

    "\n",
    "The internals of the computation are abstracted away, and you only need to focus on two main\n",

    "- data files are split into chunks and processed by some number of Map tasks. They generate zero or\n",
    "  more key-value pairs as intermediate results.\n",
    "- the intermediate results are gathered and shuffled/sorted by key and passed to Reduce tasks so that\n",
    "  each reduce task receives all values associated with a single key.\n",
    "- there are several Reduce tasks that process these key-value pairs and combine/aggregate all the\n",
    "  values associated with a single key in some way."
