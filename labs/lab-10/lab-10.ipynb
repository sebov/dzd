    "## 2*. Anomaly Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Anomaly detection is the task of identifying rare events or outliers in a dataset. However, it\n",
    "differs from data quality validation in that its focus is not on ensuring data correctness, but\n",
    "rather on identifying unexpected or rare patterns. Although distinct, both anomaly detection and\n",
    "data quality issues can influence the performance of machine learning models, but for different\n",
    "reasons. Data quality issues usually concern the validity of data (e.g., missing or incorrect\n",
    "values), while anomaly detection focuses on unusual patterns and outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, distinguishing between the two can be challenging. For example, consider a dust or\n",
    "fine-particle sensor. If a sensor in the kitchen registers a maximum value while food is being\n",
    "prepared on a frying pan, this could be considered an anomaly, yet it might also be a theoretically\n",
    "correct reading (if the sensor has an upper limit on its readings range). On the other hand, if the\n",
    "sensor stops providing readings due to a battery outage, this can be considered a data quality issue\n",
    "rather than an anomaly in the dust sensor data stream (but depending on the domain context, it can\n",
    "be interprted as an anomaly as well).\n",
    "\n",
    "*There is also another aspect to consider - the presence of data drift. Data drift refers to the\n",
    "process by which a data distribution changes over time. It can be caused by various factors, such as\n",
    "changes in the environment, modifications of the data collection process, or shifts in the\n",
    "underlying data itself. Data drift can have a significant impact on the performance of machine\n",
    "learning models, as it may cause them to become less accurate over time if they were trained on a\n",
    "different data distribution. For now, however, we will treat data drift as a separate topic that is\n",
    "out of the scope of this lab.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Tere are several open-source libraries that can be used for anomaly detection. Sometime these are\n",
    "libraries specialized in anomaly detection for specific domains or data types. Just to name a few:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alibi Detect - https://docs.seldon.ai/alibi-detect\n",
    "- PyOD - https://pyod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n",
    "- Anomalib - https://anomalib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n",
    "\n",
    "Familiarize yourself with the above libraries. Choose one of them and experiment with the dataset\n",
    "used in the previous section. Simulate/introduce some anomalies into the dataset and try to detect\n",
