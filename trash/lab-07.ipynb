    "# Lab 07 - Model Prediction Speed\n",

    "During this lab we will explore the prediction speed of different models and model serving\n",
    "frameworks. This is important for understanding how model architecture, deployment environment,\n",
    "and other factors affect real-time inference performance and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple approaches to serving machine learning models in production environments. We can\n",
    "imagine the following scenarios (the may overlap):\n",
    "\n",
    "- batch prediction: where we predict on a large number of samples at once, e.g., offline predictions\n",
    "  done on a daily basis\n",
    "- real-time prediction: where we need to make predictions as soon as new data arrives, e.g., online\n",
    "  predictions for user recommendations or fraud detection systems\n",
    "- streaming prediction: where we predict on data streams, e.g., financial market predictions or IoT\n",
    "  sensor data\n",
    "- low-latency prediction: where we need to minimize the time between receiving input and producing\n",
    "  output\n",
    "- edge deployment: where models are deployed on devices with limited computational resources\n",
    "- embedded model: where models are integrated into applications without a separate serving layer,\n",
    "  e.g., a mobile app that uses a pre-trained model for image classification\n",

    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to serve machine learning models. Some popular options include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- in-process model serving within an application, e.g., loading a model directly in a Python code\n",
    "  and using it for predictions\n",
    "- building a custom REST API using Flask or FastAPI frameworks, etc.\n",
    "- using model serving frameworks specific to a particular ML ecosystem, e.g., TensorFlow Serving,\n",
    "  TorchServe, etc.\n",
    "- general-purpose or multi-framework model serving platforms, e.g., MLflow, BentoML, MLServer,\n",
    "  Seldon Core, KServe, NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, ONNX Runtime, OpenVINO, Ray Serve, etc. Some\n",
    "  of these use other serving runtimes under the hood.\n",
    "- frameworks supporting advanced inference logic and ML workflows, such as inference graphs,\n",
    "  ensembles, or workflow pipelines, e.g., Seldon Tempo SDK, Kubeflow Pipelines, KServe, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, the above options may overlap.\n",
