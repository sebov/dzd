    "means that if items from `A` are purchased, then items from `B` are also purchased. We will refer to\n",
    "`A` as the antecedent and `B` as the consequent of the rule. It is quite common to consider\n",
    "consequents as single items, as it is easier to interpret the rules. For example, if the client buys\n",
    "bread and milk, then what other item is likely to be purchased with them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an association rule `A -> B`.There are several metrics that can be used to evaluate\n",

    "- `support` - the ratio of transactions that contain items from both `A` and `B` to the total number\n",
    "  of transactions (alternatively, just the number of such transactions); we can interpret it as how\n",
    "  often the rule applies,\n",
    "- `confidence` - the ratio of transactions that contain both `A` and `B` to the number of\n",
    "  transactions that contain `A`; we can interpret it as the probability of purchasing `B` given that\n",
    "  `A` was purchased,\n",
    "- `coverage` - the ratio of transactions that contain items from `A` to the total number of\n",
    "  transactions; we can interpret it as how often is `A` purchased; it informs us about the general\n",
    "  popularity of items from `A` in transactions and what is the fraction of transactions that the\n",
    "  rule is under consideration (no matter if `B` is purchased or not).\n",
    "  \n",
    "<span style=\"color:gold\">Note:</span> The concept of coverage can be defined not only\n",
